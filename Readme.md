# Algorithmic Trading Platform - Server

## Desciption

Project under the **Programming Club, IIT Madras**.

The primary aim of this project is to implement a low-latency server which will receive order requests from users to maintain an order book, and send them confirmations when the orders are fulfilled. This requires us to parse the incoming HTTP requests, maintain user information, process placing and cancelling of orders and fulfilling orders. The choice of library for implementing the server is [Boost.asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html). If the primary mentioned goals are attained, then we will also try to implement encryption for client server communication security.
